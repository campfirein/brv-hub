  "long_description": "A structured workflow for creating implementation plans that leverage ByteRover's existing knowledge. Queries architecture, conventions, and related implementations, then uses goal-backward methodology to derive concrete tasks from desired outcomes. Produces a sequenced task breakdown with file paths, verification steps, and dependencies. Stores the plan via brv curate for downstream execution.",
