  "long_description": "A structured workflow for wrapping up work — either completing a milestone (shipping) or pausing work mid-phase (handoff). Shipping runs a pre-flight audit, gathers stats, produces a retrospective, evolves the project record, and optionally creates a git tag. Pausing compresses current work state into a resumable handoff stored via brv curate for seamless session continuation.",
